It can be awkward to take material on a one-way trip from a blog post into a professional publishing tool like InDesign: It would be harder to constantly revise and improve the work. Therefore, I have made a conscious decision to use text files in Markdown format for everything I publish, end to end. Many successful authors have much higher standards for the format and layout of their books, and they may not be satisfied with Markdown. I understand that, but the tradeoff works for me.
